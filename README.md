This is code I wrote for the course 02-604 2024 Spring session, where I used python (also GO in first week) to wrote functions that works for bioinformatics algorithms like global alignment, motif finding, and so on.
Here is the link to the corresponding week quizes of each ipynb: https://cogniterra.org/course/296/syllabus

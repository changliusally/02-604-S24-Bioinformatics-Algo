Here are the codes I wrote for the course 02-604 2024 Spring session, where I used python (also GO in first week) to wrote functions that works for bioinformatics algorithms like global alignment, motif finding, and so on.

Here is the link to the corresponding week quizes of each ipynb to understand their functions: https://cogniterra.org/course/296/syllabus, and below I provided some more explaination on code purpose.

**week3_code – Protein Fragmentation for Mass Spectrometry**
This script generates all possible contiguous substrings (peptides) from a given protein sequence. It mimics the peptide fragmentation that occurs during mass spectrometry, helping to simulate the types of fragments that can be identified based on their mass.

**week5_code – Global Alignment Implementation**
This code implements the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for global sequence alignment. It constructs an optimal alignment between two sequences by maximizing a scoring function based on matches, mismatches, and gaps—an essential task in comparing biological sequences.

**week8_code – UPGMA for Phylogenetic Tree Construction**
This script implements the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) algorithm, a hierarchical clustering method used to infer phylogenetic trees from pairwise distance matrices. The algorithm groups taxa based on evolutionary distance, assuming a constant rate of evolution.

**week10_code – Suffix Tree Construction with DFS**
This code constructs a suffix tree for a given string and uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree. Suffix trees are powerful data structures for fast pattern matching and are fundamental in string processing applications such as genome analysis.
